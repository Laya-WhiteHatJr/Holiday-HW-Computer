    <p>Our school celebrated the independence day startting with the march past by the X & XI graders.
        We had a program about the achievments of India since Independence. we also saw a skit by the 8th graders,
         about the struggle tht india faced during the rule of british.
        then the 7th and 6th grade students sang a patriotic song to show their love towards India.
